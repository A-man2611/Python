#WAP to ask the user to enter names of their 3 fav movies & store them in a list

fav_mob1 = input("Enter the first mov:" )
fav_mob2 = input("Enter the second mov:")
fav_mob3 = input("Enter the third mov:")

list_mov = []
list_mov.append(fav_mob1)
list_mov.append(fav_mob2)
list_mov.append(fav_mob3)
print("Your top3 mov are: ",list_mov)

#or you can you use for loop also but not taught so better go by easy approach ;-)
